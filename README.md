# Flipper_Zero_Toyota_Prius_Opener
This is a project that contains some Raw files that open my 2006 Toyota Prius MK2 using the Flipper Zero.

This is only a raw capture it might not work on your vehicle.

The phob uses rolling code but for me it opened my car multiple times.

This a Picture of the remote:
